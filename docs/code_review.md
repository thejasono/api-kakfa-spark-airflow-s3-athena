# Code Review Summary

## Spark Structured Streaming (`spark/app/spark_processing.py`)
- ✅ Session bootstrap cleanly separates credential handling and supports injecting a custom endpoint, keeping the job flexible across AWS S3 deployments. 【F:spark/app/spark_processing.py†L1-L209】
- ⚠️ The job calls `awaitTermination()` and only stops the Spark session in a `finally` block. This means the container will run indefinitely unless the streaming query terminates (for example because the process receives SIGTERM). That is fine when you supervise it with Docker Compose/Kubernetes, but keep it in mind if you ever run this module directly because the `spark.stop()` call is effectively unreachable during normal operation. 【F:spark/app/spark_processing.py†L86-L106】
- ⚠️ Static AWS keys are still supported, but when you deploy on AWS consider switching to IAM roles (IRSA on EKS, instance profiles on EMR/EC2). To do that, omit `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` so the code falls back to the default provider chain and can pick up temporary credentials automatically. 【F:spark/app/spark_processing.py†L28-L65】

## Kafka producer (`dags/producer/kafka_streaming_service.py`)
- ✅ Uses defensive coding: topic creation is idempotent, HTTP fetch retries gracefully, and there is a synthetic fallback payload so the DAG keeps producing data even if `randomuser.me` is unavailable. 【F:dags/producer/kafka_streaming_service.py†L1-L211】
- ⚠️ `STREAMING_DURATION`/`PAUSE_INTERVAL` are integer-divided to determine the number of loop iterations. If you change them so that the duration is not a multiple of the pause interval, the last partial interval will be ignored. Consider using a time-based loop if you need more flexibility. 【F:dags/producer/kafka_streaming_service.py†L185-L209】
- ⚠️ Delivery reports are printed to stdout. For production usage you may want to plug them into structured logging instead so they end up in the centralised log aggregator you use with Airflow. 【F:dags/producer/kafka_streaming_service.py†L150-L173】

## Airflow DAG (`dags/kafka_stream_dag.py`)
- ✅ Lazy-importing the producer code keeps DAG parsing lightweight and avoids import errors when optional dependencies are not installed. Nice touch! 【F:dags/kafka_stream_dag.py†L14-L55】
- ⚠️ The DAG schedules a finite producer task every five minutes. If you later convert the producer into a long-running service, move it out of Airflow and supervise it separately; Airflow tasks are expected to finish. The comments at the bottom of the file already hint at this constraint. 【F:dags/kafka_stream_dag.py†L61-L147】

## Suggested follow-ups
1. Add automated tests for the Spark transformer to guard the JSON schema and hashed ZIP implementation. A tiny local DataFrame with one or two records would suffice.
2. Consider exposing `STREAMING_DURATION`/`PAUSE_INTERVAL` via Airflow variables so you can tweak the cadence without rebuilding the image.
3. Document how to audit IAM permissions when rotating AWS credentials.
